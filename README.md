# 📦 WGUPS Routing Program

This project simulates a delivery system for the **Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS)**. It focuses on solving routing, timing, and delivery constraints.
It was developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms II course, with a focus on building core functionality from scratch — including a custom hash table and nearest neighbor delivery algorithm.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The WGUPS Routing Program:

- Loads and delivers 40 packages with constraints
- Tracks real-time delivery status (At Hub, En Route, Delivered)
- Optimizes routes using the nearest neighbor algorithm
- Reduces total mileage across multiple trucks
- Adheres to rules like grouped deliveries, time delays, and corrected addresses

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **Custom Data Structures**  
  Built a hash table from scratch using chaining (no dictionaries)

- **Routing Algorithm**  
  Implemented a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm for path optimization

- **File Handling**  
  Loaded and parsed `.csv` files for distance, address, and package data

- **Time Simulation**  
  Simulated delivery progress and tracked delivery times

- **Object-Oriented Programming**  
  Designed with modular classes: `Package`, `Truck`, `HashMap`

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Real-time tracking of package status and delivery times
- ✅ Route optimization using nearest neighbor (greedy algorithm)
- ✅ Constraints respected (e.g., grouped packages, late availability)
- ✅ Menu to view all packages or search by ID at any time
- ✅ Total mileage tracking for each truck and overall
